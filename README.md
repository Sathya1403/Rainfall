# Rainfall Detection
Rain fall prediction : I created a model to predict the Areas with high rainfall and Areas with low rainfall.

I collected the some datas and created a csv file.My dataset comprises of
  1.State
  2.District
  3.Year
  4.Monthly Rainfall Rate
  5.Annual rainfall rate in every place
Prediction:
  With the mean of overall annual rainfall prediction is made as
   (Higher than the mean value) 0-> High Rainfall Region
  (Lower than the mean value) 1-> Low Rainfall Region

Got an accuracy of 83.33%.
